This is a smart wrist-worn device, which can measure someone's heart rate, oxygen level, body temperature and also the acceleration motion of his body. The device sends these data to a cloud server and when any abnormal behaviour of a parameter is detected, the system takes necessary actions. User can add a list of emergency contacts, to whom the system can automatically send notifications in a medical emergency situation. Also, user can view a summary of his real-time health condition via the mobile application, which comes with the system itself.

Additionally, the system has a feature to set reminders for timely medications and inform respective parties if a medical doze is missed. This feature is very useful for elderly and also for people who are very busy with their daily routines.
